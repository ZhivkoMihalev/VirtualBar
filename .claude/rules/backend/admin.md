# Admin

Admin is determined by `AppUser.IsAdmin` (bool, default `false`). It is:
- Exposed via `ICurrentUser.IsAdmin` (reads the `"isAdmin"` JWT claim)
- Emitted in the JWT by `AuthService.GenerateJwtToken`
- Included in the auth response as `AuthUserDto.IsAdmin`
- **Seeded on startup:** if `AdminEmail` is set in config (typically `appsettings.Development.json`, gitignored), that user's `IsAdmin` is set to `true` automatically on `dotnet run`

Admin checks always live in the **`XxxValidationDecorator`** — never in controllers or inner services:
```csharp
if (!currentUser.IsAdmin)
    return Result<T>.Forbidden("Only administrators can do this.");
```
